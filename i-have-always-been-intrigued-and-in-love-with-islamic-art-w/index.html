<p>Every piece shared, has had a profound effect on myself when I first saw it. There are more pieces to come from Turkey, the first few sets are to gauge peoples interests, and I will also be taking suggestions on what you would like to see made available. Moving forward the plan is to find more art from different countries not restricted to Turkey. I figured we all have to start from somewhere, and there’s not a better place to begin than from Turkey, a country rich with history, where every street boasts spiritually inspired architecture, and a country where the Islamic arts are still alive and flourishing.</p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-white colors-global " data-reactid="20"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="21"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="22"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="23"><span data-reactid="24"><!-- react-empty: 25 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="26"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="27"></a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="28"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="29"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="30"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
