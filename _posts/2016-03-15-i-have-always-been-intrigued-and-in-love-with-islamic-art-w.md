The Beginning: Hiç Arts

I have always been intrigued and in love with Islamic art, whether it was the geometric shapes with their repetition, angles and accuracy, or the flowing arabesque with it's visual rhythm, or the ebb and flow found in the strokes of calligraphy works. I could sit for hours looking at one piece, following the lines as they reach high for the skies, or whirl around each other in an endless abyss of beauty.

Islamic art has been a source of reflection, escape, and introspection. All I really wanted was to be able to create something just as beautiful, to cover the walls in my home with, and to share it with others, so they too can experience the presence and transformative power of art.

It wasn't until recently that I started to learn more about Islamic art, its creation and evolution, as well as its esoteric meanings. How every stroke calls upon reflection, and how its mere existence calls back to the Creator. I learned that not too long ago Islamic civilizations surrounded themselves with beauty through architecture and art, from their home décor to their clothing. The arts were a direct reflection of their spiritual states.

As the spiritual states have the power to create beautiful visual works of dhikr (remembrance), the reverse is also true. I then started to wonder how come we deprive ourselves from such beauty in our daily lives, and even more so could we bring this practice back, of beautifying our spaces and involve ourselves in reviving the Islamic arts?

Looking into beautifying my own space, I realized that most of the art available was too expensive (as most art is these days, and for good reason), and at times even inaccessible. A few months pass and I found myself in a position where I was able to purchase art pieces from calligraphers in Turkey for affordable prices, and I thought to myself, why can't art from expert calligraphers be this easy to find in Canada? I decided that I would like to make this possible, so everyone I know, or don't know, the average person who felt restricted by the price tags of art but would still like to invest in quality pieces to beautify their homes and their hearts, is now able to do so.

And so came about the idea for Hiç Arts -- to help revive the Islamic arts, in a time where our world is broken, our hearts are broken, and there is so much uncertainty and ugliness in the world; to share these works with the world for affordable prices, to beautify our homes with the intention of healing our souls and inspire reflection in our daily lives.

Every piece shared, has had a profound effect on myself when I first saw it. There are more pieces to come from Turkey, the first few sets are to gauge peoples interests, and I will also be taking suggestions on what you would like to see made available. Moving forward the plan is to find more art from different countries not restricted to Turkey. I figured we all have to start from somewhere, and there's not a better place to begin than from Turkey, a country rich with history, where every street boasts spiritually inspired architecture, and a country where the Islamic arts are still alive and flourishing.
